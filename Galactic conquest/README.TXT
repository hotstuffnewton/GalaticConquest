Try your hand at Commanding Earths fleet successfully for 10 years of WAR!
The Rules: 
•	The game lasts 10 years, with one year being one turn. 

•	Each year, you decide on how many planets to sell for Dark Matter. This is used for fuelling your fleet.

•	Each year you can decide on how many ships to dismantle for Dark Matter.

•	Each ship needs 20 tons of dark matter a year to fight, without fuelling your fleet you cannot invade at full strength.

•	The price of each planet changes each year no thanks to the fools you left in charge.

•	Each year something happens within your empire that you cannot control, for good or bad you must address the situation to continue the war effort.

•	At the end of the 10th year your command will be evaluated and you'll be ranked on upon progress.

•	You cannot sell more planets than you have conquered.

•	You cannot dismantle more ships then you own.

•	You cannot fuel a ship with more than 20 tons of Dark Matter.

•	Every time you attack a star system you risk losing ships.

•	For every planet you have under your control you gain dark matter and ships. At the rate of production of that year.

•	You cannot enter in a number with a decimal point.

•	You cannot enter a character. 

•	You cannot dismantle more than 90% of your fleet 

•	You do not have to sell planets or dismantle ships every turn although it is advised.
